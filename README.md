### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I tried myself in various fields and, based on this experience, decided to build a career as a front-end developer. I worked in a digital agency for more than a year, at the same time I completed courses from Hexlet to improve my skills, and also have a good mathematical education. At the moment, I am looking for a project/job to demonstrate my current knowledge and continue to grow as a specialist.

## My education
- Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPBPU), electric power and electrical engineering engineer
- Hexlet, profession "Frontend-developer"
